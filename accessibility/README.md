13. **Error Identification** and suggestions help users with cognitive disabilities correct mistakes in forms.
14. **Focus Indicators** highlight which element is currently focused on by the user, aiding keyboard navigation.
15. **Responsive Design** ensures that websites are usable on different devices and screen sizes, including mobile devices.
16. **Avoiding Auto-Play** of videos and audio allows users to control media playback, preventing unexpected disruptions.
17. **Descriptive Link Text** provides clear and informative links that convey their purpose or destination.
18. **Testing with Users** involves gathering feedback from individuals with disabilities to ensure real-world usability.
